This was my first mod I made, so much of it is experimental. You'll find a wide variety of items, blocks, mobs, echantments, armor, tools, and much more. Featured content includes:

 - Five new ores and metals (copper, tin, bronze, steel, and the fictional zyron)
 - A tin foil hat that gives different effects based on its enchantments
 - A new breed of radioactive sheep that seek out regular sheep to infect them with radioactivity
 - A comtaminated swamp that is home to these sheep
 - Raw versions of ores before they were featured in 1.17
 - 10 new enchantments
